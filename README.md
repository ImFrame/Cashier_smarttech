 "Self-cashier" is a system that integrates both hardware and software components. The hardware includes a robotic arm responsible for picking up items and placing them on a conveyor belt. The conveyor belt then transports the items to a camera for detection and classification, followed by the generation of a receipt. Another robotic arm is employed to pack the items into bags for the customer to take home.

On the software side, machine learning algorithms are utilized for product classification, and the data is stored in a database. A web page is created to display the list of products on the current bill, along with the generated receipt.

This innovative system streamlines the checkout process and enhances the overall shopping experience for customers.
